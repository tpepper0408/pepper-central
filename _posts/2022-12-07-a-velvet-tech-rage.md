This is a repost of a blog I wrote for a work blog platform back in June 2020 for Pride Month. It came about as a *coming out* at work and a way for me to start writing about my experiences as a gay man in tech. I've not edited much here so it's pretty raw - just removed some specific reference to the company to make it more general. Enjoy!

## A Velvet Tech Rage
In the spirit of pride month, I wanted to talk about my professional and personal experiences as a gay cis-gendered man in tech. I’ve been dipping my toes into LGBTQ+ resources shared around the month and it has inspired me to reflect on my experiences.

I started at in my current role around 2 years ago. As with any workplace, it’s a gamble whether you should be openly LGBTQ+. This isn’t the fault of the management or even the people, it’s usually a defence mechanism built into how you approach new places, groups and experiences. You never know if this particular place will have a culture of homophobia or (more likely these days) transphobia, so you go into a phase of trying to *pass*. I controlled my behaviour, I didn’t mention personal relationships, I didn’t go into details about what I got up to in my personal life unless it fit into the heterosexual mould. It is particularly overwhelming at a consultancy because not only have you got the culture and people in the business but then every time you switch client you have the same thing all over again.

It doesn’t help that I also have a penchant for gender and identity politics. I tend to find any whiffs of discrimination offensive but then have to weigh up speaking out with exposing myself as a homosexual. I remember in the first few months of being in my current role desperately holding my tongue on a few occasions. The time a colleague was less than complimentary about a prominent female tennis player; the time a colleague mentioned that all men were better than women at sports; the time that a colleague outed me to the client by declaring that I should be known as ‘Gay Tim’ so everyone knows which Tim we are talking about.

I didn’t always succeed in keeping my mouth shut! If anything, it goes to show that a place that puts so much effort into diversity and inclusion still has some way to go in realising what micro-aggressions look like. I’ve seen much worse. It takes time to feel comfortable enough in a new environment to be able to point out instances of everyday sexism, homophobia and transphobia. However, diving into the experiences of the people on the other side of these comments is a good start. Empathy is a first step.

Hiding my true feelings about discrimination is all part of a practiced strategy that I have learned to deal with the fact that some group situations could turn violent and be incredibly unpleasant. Some of this is imagined, a paranoia built in from the internalised homophobia I have experienced for years. The talk by Morgana Bailey ‘The danger of hiding who you are’ goes some way into explaining what the damage of internalising homophobia can do, reducing the life span of those that live in the closet in hostile environments by up to 12 years.

She quotes a 2013 Deloitte study that found 83 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual people change some aspects of their personality to stop them from appearing ‘too gay’. The fact that you could be discriminated against causes a lot of anxiety. The strategies you come up with to hide and cope take a lot of energy and just feel rotten after a while.

Other reasons for staying closeted are much more concrete. [A review of the experiences of LGBT people commissioned](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/539682/160719_REPORT_LGBT_evidence_review_NIESR_FINALPDF.pdf) by the Government Equalities Office in 2016 found that "LGB&T people continue to face discrimination, harassment, disadvantage and inequality in the UK in a number of different policy areas" and that "Certain LGB&T groups are found to be at particular risk of hate crime – notably gay men, young people and those from black and ethnic minority groups". It goes without saying that I am privileged to be a white cis-gendered man, these numbers get much worse for trans people and people from BAME backgrounds. The experiences of people that fall into numerous ‘outside’ groups are often multi-faceted and have their own brands of discrimination. It’s important to learn about them.

[A study by stonewall in 2017](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/system/files/lgbt_in_britain_hate_crime.pdf) found that:
- One in five LGBT people (21 per cent) have experienced a hate crime or incident due to their sexual orientation and/or gender identity in the previous 12 months.
- Two in five trans people (41 per cent) have experienced a hate crime or incident because of their gender identity in the previous 12 months.
- More than a third of LGBT people (36 per cent) say they don’t feel comfortable walking down the street while holding their partner's hand. This increases to three in five for gay men.
- Four in five LGBT people (81 per cent) who experienced a hate crime or incident didn't report it to the police

Hopefully this goes some way into explaining why being outed is a mortifying experience. You could be exposing someone to danger and mental anguish. For one thing, that person may think they are passing since they are putting so much effort into it. The power of revealing something that can have negative consequences for your professional life has been taken away from you. It’s a breach of your personal autonomy and can be incredibly upsetting. It’s also no lie that LGBTQ+ people are more likely to suffer poorer mental health, having higher instances of depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harm and alcohol and substance abuse. So be kind.

I’m trying not to be too doom and gloom about this, so the obvious question is "what can we do to make it more welcoming to LGBTQ+ people?". I think the thing to focus on is promoting an organisation as a place that has no problem with LGBTQ+ people and is in fact a place we want LGBTQ+ people to be. Ease us into being comfortable here. Some things that would have helped me:
- Listen, don’t assume anything - every person is in a different place with their sexuality and/or gender identity. Some people live happily outside the closet and others are peeking out, trying not to scare themselves back in. Some people will never leave the closet for many reasons, it is not your duty to help them out of it.
- Never, ever out someone - there is never a good reason to do this, even if you think they will be OK with it.
- Promote a welcoming attitude to all - each place has its own hegemonic masculinity and femininity; you have to figure out what straight men act like before you can pretend to be one. Aspiring to engender a positive, inclusive view of masculinity and femininity makes this process much better for anyone who doesn’t fit the mould regardless of gender and sexuality.
- Be clear that you stand up for LGBTQ+ people – this is a no brainer on my part. Clear affirmation that the organisation stands by its people is basic to making LGBTQ+ people feel comfortable here.
- Be kind.

I’m happy to say that I don’t have any trouble talking about my sexuality at work anymore. I still don’t reveal my sexuality in new situations but that’s because I don’t want to until I have sussed out the place and found my escape routes. The best thing to do, in my opinion, is make the process of LGBTQ+ people at work feeling comfortable enough to be themselves as smooth as possible. Sharing resources and experiences are a great way to start thinking about these things. A lot of LGBTQ+ people are fighting an internal battle, anxious and vying for acceptance. Listen to them and stand up for them, help LGBTQ+ people feel like they are not going to suffer negative consequences by being themselves.
