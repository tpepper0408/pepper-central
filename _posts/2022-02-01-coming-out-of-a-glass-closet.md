Hello theydies and gentlethems. For LGBT+ history month I thought it would be a good idea to talk about coming out and what it means, you’ll have heard the terms *coming out*, *outing* and *in the closet*, but do you know where they came from and what they mean to LGBT+ folk?

## Origins
### Coming Out
Before there was a closet, there was coming out. It may seem archaic, in some circles young women are presented to society during debutante balls to this day, and when they are presented they are *coming out* to enter a world of eligible bachelors. This is the sense in which coming out was used initially by gay men in the early 1900s in America, it wasn’t that they were coming out of anywhere in particular, they were entering a world of homosexual society[^2]. They were being presented at drag balls modelled after debutante balls. In pre-WW2 America, it was often reported on publicly as a person entering the homosexual scene of a particular city[^1].
> “The coming out of new debutantes into homosexual society was an outstanding feature of Baltimore’s eighth annual frolic of the pansies.” Baltimore Afro-American, 1931 [^11]

The culture of ballroom continues to this day, although it has evolved a lot since the first balls. Ballroom culture has been picked up by different groups across the world and has come to be a haven and community for some LGBT+ folk. You could say that Paris is still burning[^3]; drag balls are where houses (Xtravaganza, Allure, Garcon, Mugler, LaBeija and many more) compete but also form found-families for LGBT+ folk. This is where you strike a pose, vogue and practice the art of realness.

You can go into a long discussion about the language that developed in these balls and how a lot of common sayings are taken from the culture of drag but for our purposes it’s worth pointing out that *realness* is the ability to blend, i.e. the ability to pass as someone else. Something which was, and still is, celebrated in some LGBT+ circles. It is also indicative of the struggle of living as an LGBT+ person. Being able to hide who you are can be seen as a skill to be celebrated when it affords you protection.

Before the term closet was used it was more common to refer to an LGBT+ person living a double life, *wearing a mask* - which is more about the ability to live in two spaces simultaneously - pass as a straight cisgendered person when required. You were *letting your hair down* when you were with other LGBT+ folk and *putting your hair up* when you were passing. You’d leave breadcrumbs to indicate your real identity to other LGBT+ folk which meant you *dropped hairpins*. It wasn't until later that coming out was associated with the closet.

### Skeletons in the Closet
The first usage of the term closet, to mean someone who is hiding their LGBT+ identity, comes from the late 1960s. The origin is not absolutely certain but it's a term that is rife with meaning as it originally referred to a small private room for prayer. This gives it a sense of privacy and secrecy. It's a space that isn't a fully-fledged room, somewhere where you're alone and isolated, barred from participation in what happens outside. Which gives an indication of what it is like to live in there: difficult, antisocial, isolating but also safer than outside[^4].

When talking of the LGBT+ experience, the closet is not a physical space, it's a state of mind where being in there dictates a lot of your interactions with others. When you're in there, you conceal your identity or live in denial of it. You are *closeted* and you may live your life secretly. It's the opposite of being *out*. For those where their LGBT+ identity is an open secret one can be said to be in a *glass closet*. You'll find skeletons in the closet (it's probably why you shouldn't stay in there).

To be closeted is to be someone that is presumed to be the default heterosexual, cisgendered (see [heteronormativity](https://www.eldis.org/keyissues/heteronormativity)) but harbours a different sexual orientation or gender identity. Secretive as it is, the closet can be seen as oppressive and lewd. It implies you are hiding something to be ashamed of and to come out of it is to liberate yourself from the shame of an LGBT+ identity. 

However, a major element of the closet is that it never goes away. The "deadly elasticity of heterosexist presumption"[^12] means that new closets form every time you shed one, that is to say even if you come out to everyone you know then you still need to come out to every new person you meet (and even yourself) simply because most people think of sexuality and gender identity through the heteronormative lens and think of exceptions as the minority. The closet, according to Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, is actually the "defining structure of gay oppression in this century"[^13]. For some people, even if you've come to terms with elements of your sexuality or gender identity, it doesn't mean you are comfortable with it - the closet is still there. This coming out of the closet is a lot of hard work.

## What about now?
For many people, living in the closet is a reality they face every day. It's not just a case of coming out into a welcoming LGBT+ community, it's also entering a world where you might be assaulted for who you are or who you love. Coming out of the closet can be a story of someone coming to terms with themselves and becoming proud of who they are[^5].

LGBT+ folk have to deal with their own internalised homophobia, biphobia and transphobia - and the closet is where you live while you do. Not all of these phobias are the same; there's a transphobia renaissance in the UK[^7] and bi people can experience a *double closet* where they can be discriminated against from within the LGBT+ community as well as outside it[^8]. 

I can't help but feel this is getting better because, as homophobia is less pronounced, the internalisation of these phobias affect young LGBT+ folk less. However, prejudices take a long time to die, people as young as their 30s grew up while it was illegal to teach that homosexuality was normal under section 28. Older members of the LGBT+ community lived through much worse.

Phobias don't just exist internally, there are very real consequences to being openly LGBT+ in the world. This is where *outing* comes into play as it is shorthand for *forcing someone out of the closet*. A 2018 study found that this happens to around 11% of LGBT+ individuals in the workplace where their identity is shared without their consent[^9].

Outing someone can be dangerous and shouldn't be something you ever aim to do. It's a deeply personal journey which you are forcing on someone, the choice to come out is not made lightly and is often difficult. Not only could they be struggling with it in their own head, they might not want to face the external reality of homophobia just yet.
### Being yourself
There's a big difference between *covering* your identity and adapting to a culture, in the former you hide who you are for fear of repercussions (social, physical, career) and in the latter you are outwardly yourself but you adapt to the specifics of the workplace. The former has a huge mental strain and perceived or material cost of failure, the latter is a natural fitting to the established culture in any organisation. To be yourself is not something that comes to us all as the same challenge.

As Sam Clay (or Carrie Dragshaw) talks about in this video, hiding your outside life from your co-workers can be exhausting. A lot of LGBT+ folk *cover* their identity, around 19% are not out with anyone at work but that climbs to 30% with senior colleagues and 57% with clients[^10]. He also mentions the importance of allies to ensure LGBT+ folk can be comfortable being out of the closet and that 93% of people that *cover* their identity (that doesn't just apply to LGBT+ folk) said their company had inclusion as an organisational value. It's not enough to say you're inclusive - you have to do the work to be so.

So I'm coming out of my glass closet (shocker I know) but what I want it to mean is that I'm being welcomed in to a community that celebrates me for my talents, my foibles, my idiosyncrasies and my identity. The closet is a place I don't want to be. I want to *come out* into a place where I can share my life outside work without fear of reprisal - and I hope I can.
